# Deploying EdgeLake

Transform your edge nodes into members of a permissioned decentralized network, optimized to manage and monitor data and resources at the edge.

Deploy EdgeLake instances on your nodes at the edge.
* Enable services on each node.
* Stream data from your PLCs, Sensors, and applications to the edge nodes.
* Query the distributed data from a single point (as if the data is hosted in a centralized database).
* Manage your edge resources from a single point (the network of nodes reflects a Single System Image).

## Prepare Node
**Option 1**: [Install OpenHorizon Service](OpenHorizon_install.md) 
1. Install _make_ 
```shell
sudo apt-get -y install make
```

2. Follow directions in [OpenHorizon Installation](OpenHorizon_install.md) to install _docker_ and connect to OpenHorizon


3. Clone [service-edgelake](https://github.com/open-horizon-services/service-edgelake) 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/open-horizon-services/service-edgelake
cd service-edgelake
```

**Option 2**: Manually install requirements (without OpenHorizon)
1. Install _make_
 ```shell
sudo apt-get -y install make
```

2. Install docker and set permissions for non-sudo user
```shell
sudo snap install docker
USER=`whoami` 
sudo groupadd docker 
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER} 
newgrp docker 
```

3. Install _docker-compose_
```shell
sudo apt-get -y install docker-compose
```

4. Clone [service-edgelake](https://github.com/open-horizon-services/service-edgelake) 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/open-horizon-services/service-edgelake
cd service-edgelake
```

## Deploy via Open-Horizon Patterns 
1. Update _input_ section for _userInput_ section for deployment policy pattern - Edit `LEDGER_CONN` in _Query_ and _Operator_ using IP address of _Master node_
    * [deployment.policy.master.json](../archive/hzn/deployment.policy.master.json)
    * [deployment.policy.operator.json](../archive/hzn/deployment.policy.master.json)
    * [deployment.policy.query.json](../archive/hzn/deployment.policy.query.json)
```json
{            
    "serviceOrgid": "$HZN_ORG_ID",
    "serviceUrl": "$SERVICE_NAME",
    "serviceVersionRange": "[0.0.0,INFINITY)",
    "inputs": [
        {"name":"NODE_TYPE","value":"master"},
        {"name":"NODE_NAME","value":"edgelake-master"},
        {"name":"COMPANY_NAME","value":"New Company"},
        {"name":"ANYLOG_SERVER_PORT","value":"32048"},
        {"name":"ANYLOG_REST_PORT","value":"32049"},
        {"name":"TCP_BIND","value":"false"},
        {"name":"REST_BIND","value":"false"},
        {"name":  "DB_TYPE", "value":  "sqlite"},
        {"name":  "DB_USER", "value":  ""},
        {"name":  "DB_PASSWD", "value":  ""},
        {"name":  "DB_IP", "value":  "127.0.0.1"},
        {"name":  "DB_PORT", "value":  "5432"},
        {"name":  "AUTOCOMMIT", "value":  "false"},
        {"name":"LEDGER_CONN","value":"127.0.0.1:32048"},
        {"name":"DEPLOY_LOCAL_SCRIPT","value":"false"}
    ]
}
```

2. Publish Service 
```shell
make publish-service EDGELAKE_TYPE=[node_type]
```

3. Publish Policy for Service
```shell
make publish-service-policy EDGELAKE_TYPE=[node_type]
```

4. Publish Deployment policy 
```shell
make publish-deployment-policy EDGELAKE_TYPE=[node_type]
```

5. Start EdgeLake service
```shell
make agent-run EDGELAKE_TYPE=[node_type]
```

Once Service and Service Policy are defined, then users just need to execute steps 4 and 5 for each unique node being deployed

```

* Master Node 
```shell
# Publish Service 
make publish-service EDGELAKE_TYPE=master

# Publish Service Policy 
make service-policy EDGELAKE_TYPE=master

# Publish Deployment Policy 
make publish-deployment-policy EDGELAKE_TYPE=master

# Start container (deploy agent) 
make agent-run EDGELAKE_TYPE=master

# Unregister Node / takedown container 
make agent-stop EDGELAKE_TYPE=master
```

* Query Node 
```shell
# Publish Deployment Policy 
make publish-deployment-policy EDGELAKE_TYPE=query

# Start container (deploy agent) 
make agent-run EDGELAKE_TYPE=query

# Unregister Node / takedown container 
make agent-stop EDGELAKE_TYPE=query
```

* Operator Node 
```shell
# Publish Deployment Policy 
make publish-deployment-policy EDGELAKE_TYPE=query

# Start container (deploy agent) 
make agent-run EDGELAKE_TYPE=query

# Unregister Node / takedown container 
make agent-stop EDGELAKE_TYPE=query
```

* Validate Connectivity commands - configured with _default_ port values
```shell
# validate node is accessible via REST
make test-node EDGELAKE_TYPE=operator 

# validate node is able to communicate and has a valid blockchain file 
make test-node EDGELAKE_TYPE=operator 

# validate node is able to communicate with other nodes witin its network
make test-network EDGELAKE_TYPE=operator 
```

**Note**: Once a _Service_ and _Service-Policy_ have been published, there is no need to republish them 

## Deploy via make and docker-compose 
1. Update .env configurations for the node(s) being deployed - Edit `LEDGER_CONN` in _Query_ and _Operator_ using IP address of _Master node_
    * [docker_makefile/edgelake_master.env](../docker_makefile/edgelake_master.env)
    * [docker_makefile/edgelake_operator.env](../docker_makefile/edgelake_operator.env)
    * [docker_makefile/edgelake_query.env](../docker_makefile/edgelake_query.env)
```dotenv
#--- General ---

COMPANY_NAME=New Company

#--- Networking ---

REST_BIND=false

#--- Database ---

```

2. Start Node using makefile
```shell
make up EDGELAKE_TYPE=[NODE_TYPE]
```
